1. The reason to pass a key into DogCard is that giving each item a unique identity as React needs some way to know which components are new or updated or removed when rendering a list. Without the key, React might happens to reuse the wrong card or even not updated something that has changed when rendering. React uses the key to keep track of each dog card even when the list makes changes or refreshes. 

2. The second argument in the useEffect React hook is a dependency array, which is optional but recommended. It tells React when to run the effect. For example, [] represents it will only run once when the component loads, and [query] meaning that it will run every time when the query changes. If not having the second argument, the effect might run every time when rendering.
